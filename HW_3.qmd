## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
x_t_x_inv <- matrix(data = c(.02,-.02,-.02,-0.02,
                             -.02, .04, .02, .02,
                             -.02, .02, .04, .02,
                             -.02, .02, .02, 0.04), nrow = 4, ncol = 4)
l = c(1,1,0,0)
```

```{r}
t(l)%*%x_t_x_inv%*%l
```
